## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript ðŸ˜€

### What I Learned

1. How to style an input placeholder using the `::placeholder` pseudo-element and understanding its purpose.
2. The `<form>` element triggers a `submit` event, which we can intercept and control using the `submit` event listener.
3. The second parameter of `element.classList.toggle` can be used to force a class to be added or removed based on a boolean condition â€” making code cleaner than a traditional `if/else` statement.
4. JavaScript regular expression syntax, the `RegExp.test(string)` method, and how to use regex for validating form inputs.
5. Why `event.preventDefault()` is necessary on a formâ€™s `submit` event â€” to stop the default page reload and allow frontend validation before submission.
6. The `innerHTML` property, what it does, and when to use it for inserting HTML content dynamically.
7. In a flex container with two items in a row, setting `justify-content: space-between` pushes them to the far left and far right sides of the container â€” a very useful layout trick.
8. How disabling the `list-style` property and setting `li` elements to `position: relative`, combined with a `::before` pseudo-element, allows complete control over custom list item markers â€” which isnâ€™t possible with the default `list-style`.
